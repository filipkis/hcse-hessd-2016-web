  p.
    HCSE and HESSD are #[a(href='http://ifip-tc13.org/',target='_blank') IFIP TC 13] working
    conferences that bring together researchers and
    practitioners. For the first time, they will be jointly
    organized by IFIP Working Groups #[a(href='http://ifip-tc13.org/working-groups/working-group-13-2/',target='_blank') WG 13.2] and
    #[a(href='http://ifip-tc13.org/working-groups/working-group-13-5/',target='_blank') WG 13.5]. HCSE is targeted towards user interface
    design, combining software engineering and
    human-computer interaction and integrating
    human-centered design with software engineering
    processes. HESSD is concerned with the role and
    impact of human error in design, management and
    operation of safety-critical systems and leading
    edge techniques for mitigating the impact of human
    error in complex systems.
  p.
    HCSE+HESSD 2016 will
    be held at the #[a(href='www.kth.se') KTH Royal Institute of Technology] in
    Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden.
